# bootstrap

This project provides a baseline configuration for Kubernetes clusters.

## Clean Cluster Destruction

To cleanly destroy a bootstrapped cluster, follow these steps to prevent resource leaks and ensure proper cleanup. The cleanup process is now integrated into the Helm chart.

### Automated Cleanup via Helm

1. Toggling the shutdown mode in your values:

```yaml
features:
  shutdown:
    enabled: true
```

2. When applied, this configuration triggers the following actions:
   - Disables auto-sync for the bootstrap application.
   - Sets Karpenter NodePool CPU limits to "0" to prevent new node provisioning.
   - Deploys a `cluster-cleanup` Job that:
     - Restarts Karpenter.
     - Deletes all NodeClaims.
     - Verifies cleanup of Karpenter-managed resources.
   - Removes shared Gateway resources (if enabled).

3. Monitor the cleanup job:

```bash
kubectl logs -n argocd job/cluster-cleanup -f
```

4. Once the job completes successfully, proceed with infrastructure destruction using your IaC tool (e.g., Pulumi).

## Chart Changes

Most charts under `charts/` are thin wrappers that pin an upstream chart as a
dependency. Helm treats the vendored `charts/<name>/charts/*.tgz` together with
the wrapper's own `values.yaml` and `templates/` as the chart artifact, so any
change to them has to move the chart's own `version:`.

- **Dependency changes** (`Chart.yaml` dependency version, `Chart.lock`,
  vendored tarballs) bump the version for you. The `helm-deps-sync.sh`
  pre-commit hook and the `Update Helm Dependencies` workflow both re-vendor
  and bump in the same commit.
- **Hand-written changes** to `values.yaml` or `templates/` need a manual
  bump: `./scripts/bump-chart-version.sh charts/<name>`. The `Chart Version
  Check` workflow fails a pull request that changes either without raising
  the version.
- `./scripts/check-chart-version-bump.sh [base-ref]` runs the same check
  locally, and by default diffs against `origin/main`.

## Notes

- **Order matters**: Follow the steps sequentially to avoid resource leaks
- **Karpenter NodeClaims**: Must be deleted before destroying the cluster to prevent orphaned EC2 instances
- **Shutdown Mode**: Enabling shutdown mode ensures the cluster is in a safe state for destruction by preventing new resource creation and actively cleaning up dynamic resources.
